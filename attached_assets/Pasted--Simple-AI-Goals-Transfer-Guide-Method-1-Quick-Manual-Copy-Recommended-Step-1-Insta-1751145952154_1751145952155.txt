# ðŸš€ Simple AI Goals Transfer Guide

## Method 1: Quick Manual Copy (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
In your new Replit, run:
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai composio-core @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-switch @radix-ui/react-tabs lucide-react class-variance-authority tailwind-merge
```

### Step 2: Copy Core Files (4 files total)
Just copy these 4 main component files from this project to your new one:

1. **InteractiveGoalCard.tsx** â†’ `client/src/components/InteractiveGoalCard.tsx`
2. **GoalExecutionModal.tsx** â†’ `client/src/components/GoalExecutionModal.tsx` 
3. **ComposioIntegrationsModal.tsx** â†’ `client/src/components/ComposioIntegrationsModal.tsx`
4. **AIGoalsPage.tsx** â†’ `client/src/components/Pages/AIGoalsPage.tsx`

### Step 3: Copy Supporting Files
1. **goals.ts** â†’ `client/src/types/goals.ts` (from EXPORT_2_GOALS_TYPES.txt)
2. Add the 50+ AI goals data (see EXPORT_4_AI_GOALS_DATA.txt below)

### Step 4: Add to Navigation
Add this to your main navigation:
```jsx
<Link href="/ai-goals" className="nav-link">
  AI Goals
</Link>
```

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Method 2: Git Clone (Alternative)
You can also fork this entire Replit and just copy the files you need.

## Method 3: Download Individual Files
I've created complete export files with all the code:
- COMPLETE_InteractiveGoalCard.txt (410 lines)
- COMPLETE_GoalExecutionModal_Part1.txt (500 lines)
- COMPLETE_GoalExecutionModal_Part2.txt (464 lines)

## âœ… What You Get:
- 50+ business AI goals across 8 categories
- Real-time multi-agent execution with live tracking
- Composio integrations for LinkedIn, Email, Social Media
- Interactive goal cards with hover effects and detailed views
- Demo mode (works without API keys) + Live mode (real integrations)

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing After Transfer:
1. Navigate to `/ai-goals` page
2. Try hovering over goal cards
3. Click "Start Interactive Demo" on any goal
4. Verify the execution modal shows agent coordination

That's it! The components are self-contained and will work immediately.
